/**
 * <p>The type of evaluation contexts.</p>
 *
 * <p>An evaluation context provides a central place for implementations to
 * request reusable temporary storage. For example, an evaluator that serially
 * processes hundreds of joints may require several temporary matrices per
 * joint. The evaluator must either declare all storage itself, increasing the
 * memory usage required on a per-evaluator basis, or it must declare several
 * local temporary matrices and hope that the virtual machine's escape analysis
 * eliminates them. Instead, the evaluator can share an explicit evaluation
 * context with all other evaluators and can request temporary storage for
 * matrices on demand in a manner that allows the context to reuse the matrices
 * without performing extra allocations.</p>
